Before this is done, the following is needed:

[X] Bootable ISO with hardened stage3.
[ ] Minimal post-installation rootfs with Salt.
    + The Salt config doesn't need to be here; it'll come from restoration media.
    + This will need to be akin to a stage3 tarball --- the default
      installer doesn't ship with the squashfs tools.
[ ] Installer. This should
    + Do pre-installation set up. If this is not tenable with a shell script
      (i.e., don't rely on a bunch $n vars), write it in Go and static-build it.
    + Set up FDE.
    + Unpack the rootfs.
    + Do any post-installation automation; same caveat as pre-install.
    + Reboot.

    If the installer is best done as an actual program and not a pile
    of shell hacks, so be it.
