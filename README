=============

This is a set of configurations for building a quick-restore Gentoo
CD. Basically, I don't want to have to do the whole install dance
every time I want to install, so this is a fast track. It originated
from a similar effort to make Alpine Linux suitable, so there may
still be comments about Alpine lurking.

Sage internet advice: don't read the comments, particularly if you
have Opinions on things.

For the current status, see RELEASE.
