laptop-gentoo
=============

This is a set of configurations for building a quick-restore Gentoo
CD. Basically, I don't want to have to do the whole install dance
every time I want to install, so this is a fast track. It originated
from a similar effort to make Alpine Linux suitable, so there may
still be comments about Alpine lurking.

Sage internet advice: don't read the comments, particularly if you
have Opinions on things.

For the current status, see RELEASE.

The goal of this is to facilitate setting up the absolute minimum
Linux system that can be turned over to Salt to set up my work
desk/laptop environment. The specific goals that I want out of this
system are detailed in the Makefile, but the basic requirements are

  1. grsec kernel
  2. minimal base image (just enough to let Salt take over)
  3. no systemd
  4. standard Unix tooling
  5. Salt management of the actual system
